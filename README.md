## Notes

1. Temperature sensor shows 0 in the app but the professor said that it was fine because when you check the app itself and try to change the temperature there, it changes
2. There is no animation for the fling but the professor said it was fine too
3. Uploading it to google play was troubling and as of the submission, I have not been able to publish it there yet
